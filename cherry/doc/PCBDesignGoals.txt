Layers:
=======
Sticking to 2 layers for cost and ease of manufacturing. 
- Cheaper.
- Leaves more room for someone who might want to DIY the PCB itself.
- Stay with community convention, unless there is good reason not to.

Stack up:
- Top layer:
    - GND pour (stitched)
    - Horizontal signals
    - Horizontal Vcc
- Bottom layer: 
    - GND pour (stitched)
    - Vertical signals
    - Vertical Vcc

Routing:
========
Here are the main lines running through most of the board:
- Vcc
- LED Data
- 5x Row lines
- 6x Column lines

Routing Priority:
Route Vcc and GND first since they would be
 the widest lines. Also, this would allow you free reign in distrubuting
 adequate number of Vcc and GND lines evenly through the board. Then you can
route signal lines, which will be thinner, in any space left.

Trace Widths (2nd consult wanted):
Vcc & GND: 20mils
Signal: 6mils
Via: 13mils

Component placement:
====================
Top:
- OLED
- MCU
- Headphone jack
- Reset Button
- Rotary encoder

Bottom:
- WS2812B for underglow
- Kailh switches
- SK6812Mini-E for per key lighting.
    - If JLC PCB offered two sided SMT services, could use WS2812B on both sides (since SK6812MINI-E is not in their catalog).

Usability features:
===================
Testing/Debuggind ports:
- Vcc
- GND
